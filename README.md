Amazon Purchase System for Children (Voice Command-based)
Overview
This system enables children to make purchases from Amazon using voice commands through an AI-powered chatbot named "KOTANA". The system allows parents to create child accounts, assign a specific budget, and let children interact with the bot to purchase items from Amazon. It ensures that purchases are within the assigned budget and provides a safe and fun shopping experience for kids.

Features:
Parent Account Creation: Parents can create accounts for their children and assign a budget.

Voice Command Shopping: Children can interact with the AI chatbot "KOTANA" through voice commands to search and purchase items from Amazon.

Budget Control: Parents can set and track the spending budget for each child to ensure safe spending.

AI Integration: KOTANA, the AI assistant, is powered by machine learning models to handle natural language processing and guide children through the purchase process.

Item Purchase Confirmation: Once an item is selected, the system asks for parental confirmation before proceeding with the purchase.

Usage
Parent Side:

Parents can log in to the system and create child accounts.

They assign a spending budget for each child.

Parents receive notifications about any attempted purchases and can approve or deny them.

Child Side:

Children can talk to KOTANA via voice commands to search for products.

KOTANA will respond with product suggestions, which children can select.

Once the selection is made, the parent will receive a prompt to approve the purchase.

Example Flow:
Child says: "Hey KOTANA, find me a toy car."

KOTANA responds with a list of toy cars and their prices.

Child selects one by saying: "Buy this one."

KOTANA asks for confirmation: "This toy car costs $15. Do you want to proceed?"

The parent receives a notification to approve or deny the purchase.
